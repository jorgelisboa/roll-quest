# Roll Quest
Roll Quest is an app for RPG players.

When playing RPGs, various dice are required, but these kits can be too expensive for each team member. Just imagine the scenarios:
| Quantity of Kits | Approximate Price (USD) |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | $5.60 - $7.12 |
| 2 | $11.18 - $14.21 |
| 5 | $27.18, $35.56 |

With that in mind, using dice on your phone (for free) is the best option for RPG groups, and if you want a different theme, $4.99 is much less than physical dice.
